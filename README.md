# CS-350-Emerging-Sys-Arch-and-Tech

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The project was designed to create a smart thermostat. The overall goal of the project was to develop a thermostat that sends data to a server software over Wi-Fi. A temperature sensor using I2C will indicate via led illumination when the heat has been turned on. 

What did you do particularly well?

I don't think I did anything particularly well and need to further my understanding of how to properly implement embedded devices. 

Where could you improve?

I feel I could improve in a lot of areas with using embedded systems. I feel I need to use some further learning to explore that will help me better understand the methodology and the technology that runs it. I had a lot of issues with my IDE failing to operate my code which may have something to do with the use of a newer version where this course was meant to use a previous version. 

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

I'm not sure what tools I will be adding to my support network, but I'm sure there's something I will think of in the future that I utilized in the coursework for this calss and the projects. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

I'm not sure what exactly I can take from this class that I haven't already adopted from other classes to move forward with future projects and course work, but I do like to start working early to ensure I can meet deadlines. 

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I tried to make the code as clean and readable as possible. I also commented my code to express what each of the parts and fucntions were doing.
